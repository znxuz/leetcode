# LeetCode Solutions

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to various
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. Each problem solution is stored as a
separate commit, making it easy to track changes and revise the solutions over
time. This approach allows me to maintain a version history of my solutions and
improvements.

## Folder Structure

- Each language has a dedicated directory for storing the solutions of problems
- Each LeetCode problem has its own directory named by its problem description
  (e.g., `twoSum`).
- Inside each directory, you can find the solution file(s) along with any
  necessary resources or explanations.

## Commit History

- Solutions are committed each with a clear commit message indicating its
  difficulty level and the approach for both the general and optimal solutions
